## Overview

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
  
  -Started with a Mobile first approach by first sketching out a plan for the layout
  -Moved onto HTML making sure to include different sections for the img, text, and buttons
  -Got to a comfortable layout with elements where they belonged then made adjustments on position and    display from there
  -Corrected any sizing issues and moved onto responsiveness making adjustments to media for the mobile background img
  -Finished with active states color corrections and looking for any HTML and CSS possible issues

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

--background-image: url(../) -previously had issues with figuring our how to properly add background images but this help with getting the correct path

--grid-template-columns/rows  -previously wasn't comfortable using grid or with how it actually works with this project i learned how to properly size and us grid to my advantage with specific sections within divs

### Continued development

I want to continue to be comfortable creating simple components and getting stroger with CSS and differnt properties!

### Useful resources

Mdn (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) & W3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/) - Both useful when researching how to add or change certain properties with different elements when i ran into any issues
